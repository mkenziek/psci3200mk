## Formatting 

We created the first section. 

### Subsection 

How to do math mode things. 


$$
\widehat{ATE} = \overline{Y}
$$


### Creating Lists 

<!-- # there always has to be a blank line above the list  -->

- Bullet one 
- Bullet two 
  + bullet 2.5 
  
This works in a *italics* sentence. 

**bold**

## Code Chunks 

``` {r}

# imagine a ggplot here 

10 + 15 

```

### Only print your output 

```{r}
#| echo: false

# just print the output 

10 + 15

data <- c(10,11) 


```




##

Use code within the text to describe your data (n = `r sum(data)`).
